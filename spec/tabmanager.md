# Active Tab Manager Spec — §7

Third pillar (2026-08-21), split out like capture/display rather than folded
into either — this is a live, on-page UI surface with its own eventual
reconciliation into the historical container view, not a capture rule or a
historical-display rule. Grows by dated entry exactly like `capture.md`/
`display.md` — this file holds only what's built and true today; the full
phase roadmap (including phases not yet built) and the reasoning behind the
phasing live in `decisions/tabmanager.md`. Open doubts: `WATCHLIST.md`.

## 7. Live Tab Strip (Phase 1, 2026-08-21)

**Scope invariant:** Phase 1 changes nothing about capture (§3–§4). Session
lifecycle, heartbeats, Score v1, snapshots — unchanged. This is a second,
parallel *view* of tab state the background script already observes for
session-lifecycle purposes; it does not create a shadow tab system, and it
does not evict, close, or otherwise act on any tab.

* **Surface:** a shadow-DOM strip injected top-frame only
  (`window === window.top` — a strip rendered inside an iframe would be a
  bug) via the existing `content_scripts` entry (`content.js`'s injection
  point, not a new one). One tile per open tab (favicon + title).
* **Placement:** always-visible, top of the page, reserving real vertical
  space — the page's own content is pushed down, not overlaid. Chosen over
  a fixed overlay so it never covers a site's own header/nav (2026-08-21;
  known trade-off with sites carrying their own `position: sticky`/`fixed`
  top elements — see `WATCHLIST.md`).
* **Data flow:** `background.js` already receives `tabs.onCreated` /
  `onRemoved` / `onUpdated` / `onActivated` for session-lifecycle purposes;
  Phase 1 broadcasts that same event stream to the injected strip via
  `chrome.tabs.sendMessage` — event-driven, no polling (matches the
  no-keepalive posture in §2).
* **Switching:** a tile click posts `{type:'FS_SWITCH_TAB', tabId}` to the
  background, which calls `chrome.tabs.update(tabId,{active:true})`
  (+ `windows.update` if the tab is in a different window). The strip never
  calls `chrome.tabs.*` itself — only the service worker holds that
  permission's actual capability from a content-script trigger.

### Deferred
Scoring/band on tiles, eviction, closing tabs, the full ribbon/card view
(Phase 2), and how a closed tab folds into an existing historical container
(Phase 3–4). None of this is built or assumed by Phase 1 — full roadmap and
reasoning: `decisions/tabmanager.md`.
